The point of this seminar is for you to document and narrate your experience playing a game or interactive fiction using a methodology of your own design. We'll call it a "player story."

You don't need to purchase anything for this course, but you will need a [game or fiction](games.html) to play. Everything else is in UVic Libraries or the course reader. (See me for a copy.) I've kept the reading to 75 pages or less per week to help you gradually develop your own player stories and conduct research throughout the term. We'll also dedicate most of November and all of December to your player stories.

Read the complete prompts in the schedule, where you'll find further reading, too. See the ["Related Materials"](index.html#related-materials) section for more resources and be sure to review the [policies](index.html#policies) at some point.  

I suggest dedicating to this seminar 5 to 8 hours of study each week, plus 3 hours for the weekly seminar meetings. If you need an extra week to submit something without penalty, then see me for the "no questions asked" form. The late penalty after one week is three points per working day. 

With your permission, I may record audio of our sessions and circulate it via Brightspace. You'll have the option to limit personal information shared in the recording.
