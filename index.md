# tl;dr Version of this Outline

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a succinct guide to steward you through the seminar? 

I made a [one-page, tl;dr version of this outline](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is, of course, not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's an accessible reference in a pinch. 

# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of media and cultural studies. A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story in that media and culture paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? Must they unfold in real time, or might they be more reflective? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the historical, cultural, political, economic, aesthetic, technical, and/or personal dimensions of play? What, if anything, does fiction have to do with all this? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to toxicity---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own by the end of it.

Since your player story will be the final project, this seminar will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways: during seminar discussions, in writing, through play, and via your methodology, for example. I will also ask you to address the roles of documentation, attribution, accountability, accessibility, affect, and narrative in research, all of which remain deeply relevant to scholarship across the humanities and not just in game studies.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media, games, critical theory, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, but it's my first on player stories.
