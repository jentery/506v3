# tl;dr Version of this Outline

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward your trek through this graduate seminar? 

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this outline](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch. 

# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, many of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities and other public institutions to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of game studies. How, for whom, under what assumptions, and to what effects do people document and narrate their experiences of games and interactive fiction? A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story in that game studies paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary for such a story. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? What do they say, and what do they tell us? Must they unfold in real time, and how might they be reflexive? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the personal and cultural dimensions of play, not to mention the narratives at work in games and fiction? How do they influence their communities? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to the toxicity I address [above](#about-the-seminar)---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own story by the end of it, about a game or fiction of your choice, using a methodology of your own design. This means you'll have room to experiment, develop a unique line of inquiry through the seminar, and ultimately define "player story" on your own terms through an example or "prototype." 

Since your player story will be your final project, we will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways: during seminar discussions, in writing, through play, and via your methodology. I will also ask you to consider the roles of documentation, accountability, accessibility, affect, and narrative in research, each of which remains deeply relevant to scholarship across the humanities, not just in game studies.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her graduate research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media, games, cultural criticism, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, though it's my first on player stories. 

# Required Materials 

No experience with games or media is expected for this seminar. I will assume you are new to game studies. 

You won't need access to a gaming computer or console; however, you will need access to the internet and a computer. For your final project, I will prompt you to play at least one game or interactive fiction, and to document and narrate that process in some way. More on that in a second.  

I am not asking you to purchase any books for this seminar. I will instead direct you to materials in UVic Libraries and also distribute a course reader of screen-readable PDFs that you may choose to print. If a PDF in the course reader is not accessible or searchable, then please let me know. I'll fix and redistribute it.

The following fair dealing statement applies to each PDF appearing in the course reader: "This copy was made pursuant to the Fair Dealing Guidelines of the University, library database licenses, and other university license and policies. The copy may only be used for the purpose of research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire or parody. If the copy is used for the purpose of review, criticism or news reporting, the source and the name of the author must be mentioned. The use of this copy for any other purpose may require the permission of the copyright owner."

To recap, then, you're not required to purchase anything for this seminar, yet you will need access to: 
* The internet, 
* A computer, 
* UVic Libraries, 
* The course reader, which I'll circulate in PDF, 
* A game or interactive fiction (see the list below), and 
* A way to document your experiences playing that game or fiction (also more below). 

Beyond that, I invite you to visit the ["Related Materials"](#related-materials) section of this outline for lists of game studies books, journals, podcasts, and resources I suggest if you find yourself to be keen on the field. 

# Pick a Game or Interactive Fiction

A player story needs a primary source, so I created a [list of roughly 150 games and interactive fictions](games.html) (also a [GG list](https://ggapp.io/sfam/lists/playlist-6ag87zsj)) to help you choose one. In fact, choosing one is an assignment for Week 6 (October 13th). I'm open to suggestions if nothing on the list interests you or you came to the seminar with a particular game or interactive fiction in mind. The game or fiction you select just needs to be something I have played and studied a bit (or I could play and study this term). Thanks for meeting me halfway. 

Perhaps most important, please don't hesitate to ask if you want me to narrow the list based on your interests, a type of game or play, your technology needs, or . . . I realize the list is pretty long, if not a little extra. 

I'll encourage to you start playing early in the term. This way you can refine your research, gather plenty of documentation, replay the game or fiction where necessary, and share your work in progress. How you document your play, how you define and compose a player story, and what you ultimately say or argue will be up to you; however, I'll nudge you to try a few techniques before you select one for your project. Notably, your player stories don't need to be high-tech. You can use audio or video, if you wish, or just text and images. I'll cover more of the player story particulars during the three workshops I've planned for the term (see Weeks 6, 12, and 13). For now, let's talk about the aims, workload, and prompts for the seminar. 

# Aims, Workload, and Prompts

My primary goal for this seminar is to create an inclusive space where you've ample time and resources to design, produce, share, and refine your own research project (i.e., a player story about a game or fiction of your choice). I've thus kept the reading load to 73 pages or less per week, and I've dedicated most of November and all of December to your projects. Related goals for the seminar include enriching your familiarity with not only game studies but also the experience of research as a mutable process with personal and cultural dimensions. Your player story will function as a site where those dimensions are observable, if not palpable. 

I've designed three workshops on the praxis of making your own player story, and I cooked up eight prompts to scaffold or direct your inquiry from early September to mid-December. This way, you've occasions to attend to your methodology and reflect on your axiology (the values at play in your approaches, language, perceptions, and decisions). You'll also iteratively develop your player story (week by week) instead of composing it from scratch during the last week or so of the term. I hope iteration will reduce your workload and render the seminar accessible for the sake of project-based inquiry.  

Here are the eight prompts in brief. See the [schedule](#schedule) below for the prompts in detail. Note that I encourage you to draft responses before the due date. Then, for the purposes of assessment, I collect them in batches of two or three. Most responses are meant to be short, descriptive, and focused, often only 250-500 words long.  
* **Prompt 1** (draft by Sept. 22; submit by Sept. 29): Use 250-300 words to describe a type of play, or a context for play, to research this term.
* **Prompt 2** (submit by Sept. 29): Use 250-300 words to describe a type of game or interactive fiction to research this term.  
* **Prompt 3** (draft by Oct. 6; submit by Nov. 3): Play a game or fiction, use three approaches to document your play experience, and then use a total of 300-500 words to describe each approach, supported by documentation. 
* **Prompt 4** (draft by Oct. 13; submit by Nov. 3): Pick a game or fiction to study this term and then use 300-500 words to not only describe it but also explain why you selected it.
* **Prompt 5** (draft by Oct. 27; submit by Nov. 3): Use 500-750 words or 7-10 minutes of audio / video to critically engage any secondary source you’ve read in this seminar.
* **Prompt 6** (draft by Nov. 17; submit by Dec. 1): Use 500-750 words or 7-10 minutes of audio / video to outline the methodology you’ve in mind for your player story.
* **Prompt 7** (draft by Nov. 24; submit by Dec. 1): Use 250-300 words to write an abstract for your player story.  
* **Prompt 8** (submit by Dec. 1): Present player story material during seminar.  

I'll invite you to compose your player story across media: images and text, audio and text, or video, for instance. The final draft is due by December 15th, and I will circulate a detailed prompt for it on October 13th. Between December 1st and 8th, you'll also have a chance to submit a "revisions statement," where you'll outline any significant revisions you *would* make to your responses to Prompts 1-7. (You won't have to actually make those revisions.) 

Your player story, revisions statement, and responses to Prompts 1-8 comprise your seminar portfolio, which I will assess like so: 
* **Early work in progress** (due Sept. 29; 10% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 1 and 2 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* **Mid-term work in progress** (due Nov. 3; 20% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 3, 4, and 5 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* **Late-term work in progress** (due Dec. 1; 25% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 6, 7, and 8 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* **Revisions statement** (due Dec. 1-8; 10% of your final mark): 300-500 words outlining significant revisions you *would* make to your responses to Prompts 1-7.
* **Final project** (due Dec. 15; 35% of your final mark): The final draft of your player story. 

I will use the Faculty of Graduate Studies' [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/grad/index.php#/policy/B13jeiMdE?bc=true&bcCurrent=07%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Faculty%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your work. Please also note that I have a "no questions asked," one-week late policy for all submissions, excluding the final project. See the seminar [policies](#policies) for more on late submissions and related penalties. 

I suggest dedicating *5 to 9 hours of study each week to this seminar, plus 3 hours for the weekly seminar meetings*. Of course, 5 to 9 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the material and work involved. 

# Schedule  

The seminar schedule is below. It's subject to change, and I will announce any changes 1-2 weeks in advance. I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload. 

You will find nearly all assigned materials either online via UVic Libraries or in the PDF course reader. I link to assigned materials when they are *not* available in the Libraries or reader. 

Most weeks in the schedule include descriptions of what to do before seminar, what we'll do during seminar, and some questions to guide our inquiry that week. You'll also find detailed prompts in Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13. Please read the prompts carefully and send any questions or concerns my way. I realize any given prompt can always be better. I'll revise it.  

You'll notice that, many weeks, I point to further reading. I in no way expect you to read it. We can't read all the things, and I know you've a lot to juggle in a single term. I include further reading for the sake of scholarly integrity and in case you wish to follow a particular trajectory or topic across game studies. I will likely mention aspects of the further reading during seminar discussions, too. Feel free to tell me when I fail to effectively communicate those aspects. I'll clarify. 

The same goes for moments in the schedule when I write, "Check out (games mentioned in the assigned reading)." If you cannot or do not wish to learn more about them or play them, then no worries. I mention them only for the sake of keeping track of our primary sources as we go, and I didn't assign them all for a reason.  

Importantly, material in this seminar frequently engages or reflects issues such as racism, sexism, colonialism, cisheteropatriarchy, white supremacy, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, hegemony, death, violence, toxic masculinity, fatphobia, xenophobia, mental health, anxiety, and lived experiences of harassment and oppression. We might also find many games and works of interactive fiction to be problematic at times. I will thus conclude each seminar meeting with a brief overview of where content warnings might apply to the following week's assigned materials, and during seminar I will never call individually on you to share your experiences of such issues or to somehow represent other people with similar experiences. If you find that I am approaching any of these issues inadequately or ignorantly, then please don't hesitate to tell me or correct me, and I will learn from my mistakes. If you'd rather not speak with me directly about or during such moments, then I recommend sharing your concerns or corrections with Stephen Ross, who is currently the graduate adviser in English. 

Finally, a thing to know about me before we proceed: *I'm a planner, I always over-plan, and I’ll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or the seminar starts to struggle with scope creep, then we’ll cut material. I’ve planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine. 

(Many thanks to Julie Funk for their feedback on aspects of this schedule.)

## Week 1 (September 8th): Hello World! 

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Read Mary Flanagan's "Games as a Medium" (8 pages; from *Debugging Game History* 2016, edited by Henry Lowood and Raiford Guins),  
* Read Anastasia Salter's "Building Interactive Stories" (10 pages; from *The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities* 2018, edited by me), and 
* Check out *Pac-Man*, *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Monkey Island*, *BioShock*, *Gone Home*, Telltale's *The Walking Dead*, *my body — a Wunderkammer*, *With Those We Love Alive*, and/or Dave Morris's adaptation of Shelley's *Frankenstein* (all mentioned in the assigned reading), if you'd like. 

What are the media of games? What are some notable tensions between play and story? Between mechanics and fiction? What are the meaningful differences between a game's narrative and a player's story? 

*During our first meeting*, we'll introduce ourselves (20 minutes), review this outline as well as the plan for this term (45 minutes), and share our questions and concerns. We'll then discuss these two texts (by Flanagan and Salter; 85 minutes), which will help us to not only survey some common debates in game studies but also highlight and define several keywords in the field. We'll return to these debates and keywords throughout the seminar to ensure the language we're using is relatively clear to us all, even when our individual approaches to the material may differ.
