# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of media and cultural studies. A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story according to that media and culture paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? Must they unfold in real time, or might they be more reflective? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the historical, cultural, political, economic, aesthetic, technical, and/or personal dimensions of play? What, if anything, does fiction have to do with all this? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to toxicity---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own by the end of it.

Since your player story will be the final project, I will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways (e.g., through seminar discussion, in writing, and via your own player stories methodology). I will also ask you to address the roles of documentation, attribution, accountability, accessibility, narrative, and embodied experience in research, all of which remain deeply relevant to scholarship in the humanities.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media studies, cultural studies, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, but it's my first on player stories. 

# Materials 

No experience with games or media is expected for this seminar, and you won't need access to a gaming computer or console. You will need access to the internet and a computer, though. For your player story, you will also need to play at least one game or interactive fiction, and to document that process in some way. More on that in a second.  

I am not asking you to acquire any books for this seminar, either. I will instead distribute a course reader comprised of screen-readable PDFs, which you may choose to print. If a PDF in that read is not accessible or searchable, then please let me know. I'll fix and redistribute it.

To recap, then, you don't need to buy any books or games for this seminar, but you will need access to: 
* The internet, 
* A computer, 
* The course reader, which I'll circulate in PDF, 
* A game (see list below), and 
* A way to document your experiences playing that game (also more below). 

## Pick a Game or Interactive Fiction

A player story needs a game or fiction, so I created a [list](games.html) to help you pick one. I'm open to suggestions, too. They just need to be games I've played and studied a bit. Thanks for meeting me halfway. 

I'll encourage to you start playing early in the term. This way you can gradually refine your research, accrue plenty of documentation, and share your work in progress with us. How you document your play, and how you compose a player story, will be up to you; however, I'll nudge you to try a few techniques before stick to one. Importantly, the techniques won't need to be high-tech. You can use audio or video, if you wish, or just text and images. I'll cover more of the particulars during the three workshops I've planned for the term. 

The balance of this "Materials" section contains recommendations related to game studies. If you don't have the time for that, or you're simply not interested, then no worries. You can skip to ["Aims and Workload"](#aims-and-workload). Choose your own adventure?!?!

## Recommended Reading 

I recommend purchasing merrit k's [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), if you can. It's available as a paperback and ebook (PDF, EPUB, and MOBI), and with it you get playable versions of every game featured in the book. Neat! 

Elsewhere, the course reader is comprised mostly of chapters from academic monographs, such as Mary Flanagan's *Critical Play*, Tara Fickle's *The Race Card*, Kishonna L. Gray's *Intersectional Tech*, Patrick Jagoda's *Experimental Games*, Christopher B. Patterson's *Open World Empire*, Amanda Phillips's *Gamer Trouble*, Bo Ruberg's *Video Games Have Always Been Queer*, and T.L. Taylor's *Watch Me Play*. If you find a chapter to be especially compelling, then I recommend acquiring the entire monograph to further your research. 

If you are looking for a primer on writing games criticism, then try Ian Bogost's *How to Talk about Videogames*. There's also publications like [*Uppercut*](https://uppercutcrit.com/), [*Funland*](https://funland.itch.io/funland-issue-1), [*First Person Scholar*](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/) (also a podcast), [*Patch*](https://patchmagazine.co.uk/), and [*Unwinnable*](https://unwinnable.com/) as well as journals such as [*Ada*](https://adanewmedia.org/), [*Loading...*](https://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading), [*Well Played*](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/index.php/publication-tag/well-played/), [*Analog Game Studies*](https://analoggamestudies.org/), *Games and Culture*, *Game Studies*, *Gaming and Virtual Worlds*, and *Critical Studies in Media Communication*.  

If you're curious about the design side of games, then Anna Anthropy's *Rise of the Videogame Zinesters* is an excellent intro to experimental games and many of the issues we'll engage this term. Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric Zimmerman's *Rules of Play* is a canonical game design book that you'll find, for example, on UVic English's "Book and Media Studies" PhD exam list. Anthropy also wrote *A Game Design Vocabulary* with Naomi Clark; it grounds design in "verbs" and storytelling. Brenda Romero and Ian Schreiber's *Challenges for Game Designers* is excellent, too. It's filled with clever exercises, and I've used it in several of my prototyping classes. 

## Recommended Listening 

I like podcasts. You? Here are some podcasts that land somewhere near or inside the zone of game studies:
* [*The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook*](https://www.interactive.org/Interviews/the_game_makers_notebook.asp), which features "in-depth, one-on-one conversations between game makers." 
* [*Channel F*](https://www.fanbyte.com/channel-f-fanbyte-podcast/), where "host merritt k now subjects her coworkers to twisted challenges in order to determine who lives and who dies. Also, video games!"
* [*Critical Distance*](https://critical-distance.com/category/podcast/), "an interview series about game research supported by Critical Distance and the Digital Games Research Association."
* [*Game Studies Study Buddies*](https://rangedtouch.com/game-studies-study-buddies/), "a podcast that makes academic games studies accessible, text by text. Rather than focusing on following or forging a 'canon' of the discipline, media scholar Cameron and literature scholar Michael instead aim to cover an eclectic body of material."
* [*Gameplay*](https://gameplay.co/), "a narrative podcast about video games and the virtual worlds that power culture and community."
* [*Spawn on Me*](https://www.fanbyte.com/spawn-on-me-podcast/), "the prime video game podcast pushing gamers of color. Straight from Brookago, host Kahlief Adams brings news, previews, and reviews while probing how games affect the world."
* [*Triple Click*](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/), where "Kirk Hamilton, Maddy Myers, and Jason Schreier talk about video games and sometimes other things, too."
* [*Video Game History Hour*](https://gamehistory.org/the-video-game-history-hour/) by the Video Game History Foundation, which is "a 501(c)3 non-profit organization dedicated to preserving, celebrating, and teaching the history of video games."
* [*Waypoint Radio*](https://play.acast.com/s/vicegamingsnewpodcast) by Vice; "join Waypoint's Rob Zacny, Patrick Klepek, Renata Price, Natalie Watson, and Ricardo Contreras two times a week, as they break down the biggest stories in video games, talk about their favorite media, and unfairly compare everything to *Dark Souls*." 
* [*Woodland Secrets*](http://woodlandsecrets.co/), "the personal talk show of merritt k. It's not an interview podcast in a strict sense—instead, it's a loose, casual conversation between two friends about their work, lives, and interests."
