# tl;dr Version of this Outline

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward your trek through this graduate seminar? 

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this outline](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch. 

# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, many of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities and other public institutions to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of game studies. How, for whom, under what assumptions, and to what effects do people document and narrate their experiences of games and interactive fiction? A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story in that game studies paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary for such a story. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? What do they say, and what do they tell us? Must they unfold in real time, and how might they be reflexive? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the personal and cultural dimensions of play, not to mention the narratives at work in games and fiction? How do they influence their communities? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to the toxicity I address [above](#about-the-seminar)---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own story by the end of it, about a game or fiction of your choice, using a methodology of your own design. This means you'll have room to experiment, develop a unique line of inquiry through the seminar, and ultimately define "player story" on your own terms through an example or "prototype." 

Since your player story will be your final project, we will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways: during seminar discussions, in writing, through play, and via your methodology. I will also ask you to consider the roles of documentation, accountability, accessibility, affect, and narrative in research, each of which remains deeply relevant to scholarship across the humanities, not just in game studies.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her graduate research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media, games, cultural criticism, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, though it's my first on player stories. 

# Required Materials 

No experience with games or media is expected for this seminar. I will assume you are new to game studies. 

You won't need access to a gaming computer or console; however, you will need access to the internet and a computer. For your final project, I will prompt you to play at least one game or interactive fiction, and to document and narrate that process in some way. More on that in a second.  

I am not asking you to purchase any books for this seminar. I will instead direct you to materials in UVic Libraries and also distribute a course reader of screen-readable PDFs that you may choose to print. If a PDF in the course reader is not accessible or searchable, then please let me know. I'll fix and redistribute it.

The following fair dealing statement applies to each PDF appearing in the course reader: "This copy was made pursuant to the Fair Dealing Guidelines of the University, library database licenses, and other university license and policies. The copy may only be used for the purpose of research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire or parody. If the copy is used for the purpose of review, criticism or news reporting, the source and the name of the author must be mentioned. The use of this copy for any other purpose may require the permission of the copyright owner."

To recap, then, you're not required to purchase anything for this seminar, yet you will need access to: 
* The internet, 
* A computer, 
* UVic Libraries, 
* The course reader, which I'll circulate in PDF, 
* A game or interactive fiction (see the list below), and 
* A way to document your experiences playing that game or fiction (also more below). 

Beyond that, I invite you to visit the ["Related Materials"](#related-materials) section of this outline for lists of game studies books, journals, podcasts, and resources I suggest if you find yourself to be keen on the field. 

# Pick a Game or Interactive Fiction

A player story needs a primary source, so I created a [list of roughly 150 games and interactive fictions](games.html) (also a [GG list](https://ggapp.io/sfam/lists/playlist-6ag87zsj)) to help you choose one. In fact, choosing one is an assignment for Week 6 (October 13th). I'm open to suggestions if nothing on the list interests you or you came to the seminar with a particular game or interactive fiction in mind. The game or fiction you select just needs to be something I have played and studied a bit (or I could play and study this term). Thanks for meeting me halfway. 

Perhaps most important, please don't hesitate to ask if you want me to narrow the list based on your interests, a type of game or play, your technology needs, or . . . I realize the list is pretty long, if not a little extra. 

I'll encourage to you start playing early in the term. This way you can refine your research, gather plenty of documentation, replay the game or fiction where necessary, and share your work in progress. How you document your play, how you define and compose a player story, and what you ultimately say or argue will be up to you; however, I'll nudge you to try a few techniques before you select one for your project. Notably, your player stories don't need to be high-tech. You can use audio or video, if you wish, or just text and images. I'll cover more of the player story particulars during the three workshops I've planned for the term (see Weeks 6, 12, and 13). For now, let's talk about the aims, workload, and prompts for the seminar. 

# Aims, Workload, and Prompts

My primary goal for this seminar is to create an inclusive space where you've ample time and resources to design, produce, share, and refine your own research project (i.e., a player story about a game or fiction of your choice). I've thus kept the reading load to 73 pages or less per week, and I've dedicated most of November and all of December to your projects. Related goals for the seminar include enriching your familiarity with not only game studies but also the experience of research as a mutable process with personal and cultural dimensions. Your player story will function as a site where those dimensions are observable, if not palpable. 

I've designed three workshops on the praxis of making your own player story, and I cooked up eight prompts to scaffold or direct your inquiry from early September to mid-December. This way, you've occasions to attend to your methodology and reflect on your axiology (the values at play in your approaches, language, perceptions, and decisions). You'll also iteratively develop your player story (week by week) instead of composing it from scratch during the last week or so of the term. I hope iteration will reduce your workload and render the seminar accessible for the sake of project-based inquiry.  

Here are the eight prompts in brief. See the [schedule](#schedule) below for the prompts in detail. Note that I encourage you to draft responses before the due date. Then, for the purposes of assessment, I collect them in batches of two or three. Most responses are meant to be short, descriptive, and focused, often only 250-500 words long.  
* **Prompt 1** (draft by Sept. 22; submit by Sept. 29): Use 250-300 words to describe a type of play, or a context for play, to research this term.
* **Prompt 2** (submit by Sept. 29): Use 250-300 words to describe a type of game or interactive fiction to research this term.  
* **Prompt 3** (draft by Oct. 6; submit by Nov. 3): Play a game or fiction, use three approaches to document your play experience, and then use a total of 300-500 words to describe each approach, supported by documentation. 
* **Prompt 4** (draft by Oct. 13; submit by Nov. 3): Pick a game or fiction to study this term and then use 300-500 words to not only describe it but also explain why you selected it.
* **Prompt 5** (draft by Oct. 27; submit by Nov. 3): Use 500-750 words or 7-10 minutes of audio / video to critically engage any secondary source you’ve read in this seminar.
* **Prompt 6** (draft by Nov. 17; submit by Dec. 1): Use 500-750 words or 7-10 minutes of audio / video to outline the methodology you’ve in mind for your player story.
* **Prompt 7** (draft by Nov. 24; submit by Dec. 1): Use 250-300 words to write an abstract for your player story.  
* **Prompt 8** (submit by Dec. 1): Present player story material during seminar.  

I'll invite you to compose your player story across media: images and text, audio and text, or video, for instance. The final draft is due by December 15th, and I will circulate a detailed prompt for it on October 13th. Between December 1st and 8th, you'll also have a chance to submit a "revisions statement," where you'll outline any significant revisions you *would* make to your responses to Prompts 1-7. (You won't have to actually make those revisions.) 

Your player story, revisions statement, and responses to Prompts 1-8 comprise your seminar portfolio, which I will assess like so: 
* **Early work in progress** (due Sept. 29; 10% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 1 and 2 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* **Mid-term work in progress** (due Nov. 3; 20% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 3, 4, and 5 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* **Late-term work in progress** (due Dec. 1; 25% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 6, 7, and 8 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* **Revisions statement** (due Dec. 1-8; 10% of your final mark): 300-500 words outlining significant revisions you *would* make to your responses to Prompts 1-7.
* **Final project** (due Dec. 15; 35% of your final mark): The final draft of your player story. 

I will use the Faculty of Graduate Studies' [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/grad/index.php#/policy/B13jeiMdE?bc=true&bcCurrent=07%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Faculty%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your work. Please also note that I have a "no questions asked," one-week late policy for all submissions, excluding the final project. See the seminar [policies](#policies) for more on late submissions and related penalties. 

I suggest dedicating *5 to 8 hours of study each week to this seminar, plus 3 hours for the weekly seminar meetings*. Of course, 5 to 8 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the material and work involved. 

# Schedule  

The seminar schedule is below. It's subject to change, and I will announce any changes 1-2 weeks in advance. I will never use schedule changes to increase your workload. 

You will find nearly all assigned materials either online via UVic Libraries or in the PDF course reader. I link to assigned materials when they are *not* available in the Libraries or reader. 

Most weeks in the schedule include descriptions of what to do before seminar, what we'll do during seminar, and some questions to guide our inquiry that week. You'll also find detailed prompts in Weeks 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 13. Please read the prompts carefully and send any questions or concerns my way. I realize any given prompt can always be better. I'll revise it.  

You'll notice that, many weeks, I point to further reading. I in no way expect you to read it. We can't read all the things, and I know you've a lot to juggle in a single term. I include further reading for the sake of scholarly integrity and in case you wish to follow a particular trajectory or topic across game studies. I will likely mention aspects of the further reading during seminar discussions, too. Feel free to tell me when I fail to effectively communicate those aspects. I'll clarify. 

The same goes for moments in the schedule when I write, "Optional: check out (games mentioned in the assigned reading)." If you cannot or do not wish to check them out (e.g., Google them, watch them, or play them), then no worries. I mention them only for the sake of tracking our primary sources as we go. For that reason, I might occasionally show clips of those games and fictions during seminar.  

Importantly, material in this seminar frequently engages or reflects issues such as racism, sexism, colonialism, cisheteropatriarchy, white supremacy, ableism, homophobia, transphobia, hegemony, death, violence, toxic masculinity, fatphobia, xenophobia, mental health, anxiety, and lived experiences of harassment and oppression. We might also find many games and interactive fictions to be at times problematic. I will thus conclude each seminar meeting with a brief overview of where content warnings might apply to the following week's assigned materials, and during seminar I will never call individually on you to share your experiences of such issues or to somehow represent other people with similar experiences. If you find that I am approaching any of these issues inadequately or ignorantly, then please don't hesitate to tell me or correct me, and I will learn from my mistakes. If you'd rather not speak with me directly about or during such moments, then I recommend sharing your concerns or corrections with Stephen Ross, who is currently the graduate adviser in English. 

Finally, a thing to know about me before we proceed: *I'm a planner, I always over-plan, and I’ll opt for care in every instance.* If the workload becomes too much, or the seminar starts to struggle with scope creep, then we’ll cut material. I’ve planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine. 

(Many thanks to Julie Funk for their feedback on aspects of this schedule.)

## Week 1 (September 8th): Hello World! 

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Read Mary Flanagan's "Games as a Medium" (8 pages; from *Debugging Game History* 2016, edited by Henry Lowood and Raiford Guins),  
* Read Anastasia Salter's "Building Interactive Stories" (10 pages; from *The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities* 2018, edited by me), and 
* Optional: check out *Pac-Man*, *Dungeons & Dragons*, *Monkey Island*, *BioShock*, *Gone Home*, Telltale's *The Walking Dead*, *my body — a Wunderkammer*, *With Those We Love Alive*, and/or Dave Morris's adaptation of Shelley's *Frankenstein* (all mentioned in the assigned reading).

What are the media of games? What are some notable tensions between play and story? Between mechanics and fiction? What are the meaningful differences between a game's narrative and a player's story? 

*During our first meeting*, we'll introduce ourselves (20 minutes), review this outline as well as the plan for this term (45 minutes), and share our questions and concerns. We'll then discuss these two texts (by Flanagan and Salter; 85 minutes), which will help us to not only survey some common debates in game studies but also highlight and define several keywords in the field. We'll return to these debates and keywords throughout the seminar to ensure the language we're using is relatively clear to us all, even when our individual approaches to the material may differ. 

Further reading (not required or expected; just more context if you'd like it): 
* Ian Bogost's "Procedural Rhetoric" (64 pages; from *Persuasive Games: The Expressive Power of Videogames* 2007), 
* Elizabeth W. Bruss's "The Game of Literature and Some Literary Games" (20 pages; from *New Literary History* 9.1 1977), 
* Astrid Ensslin's "Between Ludicity and Literariness" (18 pages; from *Literary Gaming* 2014), 
* Alexander Galloway's "Gamic Action: Four Moments" (38 pages; from *Gaming: Essays on Algorithmic Culture* 2006), 
* N. Katherine Hayles's "Electronic Literature: What Is It?" (42 pages, from *Electronic Literature: New Horizons for the Literary* 2008), 
* Henry Jenkins's "Game Design as Narrative Architecture" (16 pages; self-published in 2002; republished in *First Person: New Media as Story, Performance, and Game* 2004, edited by Noah Wardrip-Fruin and Pat Harrigan),
* Nick Montfort's "Toward a Theory of Interactive Fiction" (34 pages; from *IF Theory Reader* 2011, edited by Kevin Jackson-Mead and J. Robinson Wheeler), 
* Souvik Mukherjee's "Video Games and Storytelling" (21 pages; from *Video Games and Storytelling: Reading Games and Playing Books* 2015),

* Noah Wardrip-Fruin's "Expressive Processing" (9 pages; from *The Routledge Companion to Media Studies and Digital Humanities* 2018, edited by me)

## Week 2 (September 15th): Play

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Read Mia Consalvo's "Cheating" (6 pages; from *The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies* 2014, edited by Mark J. P. Wolf and Bernard Perron), 
* Read Tara Fickle's "West of the Magic Circle: The Orientalist Origins of Game Studies" (20 pages; from *The Race Card: From Gaming Technologies to Model Minorities* 2019), 
* Read Kisha McPherson's "Are We Free to Go?: Anti-Black Racism and Its Impact on Black Play" (27 pages; in *American Journal of Play* 13.2/3 2021),  
* Read Christine O'Bonsawin's "From Black Power to Indigenous Activism: The Olympic Movement and the Marginalization of Oppressed Peoples (1968-2012)" (20 pages; in *Journal of Sport History* 42.2 2015), and 
* Optional: check out *Colossal Cave Adventure*, *Myst*, *DOOM*, *FarmVille*, and/or *Pokémon GO* (all mentioned in the assigned reading).  

How do racism, colonialism, and Orientalism shape, sustain, and preclude play? How do they not only define but also police what's fair? Does play require a sport or game? 

*During our second meeting*, we'll discuss these four texts (145 minutes), carefully engaging them to follow their lines of inquiry. As we do, we'll consider the contexts, values, and cultural histories of play (against the assertion that play is somehow apolitical or transcendent). I'll then take about five minutes to review Prompt 1, which is on the docket for next week.  

Further reading (not required or expected; just more context if you'd like it):

## Week 3 (September 22nd): Games 

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Read "The Futures of Game Studies" (24 pages; in *The Velvet Light Trap* 81 2018), a dossier by Paul Booth, Shira Chess, Kishonna L. Gray, Carly A. Kocurek, Matthew Thomas Payne, TreaAndrea M. Russworm, and Adrienne Shaw;

What do we learn from cultural approaches to games and world-building? From playing beyond the fun? 

*During our third meeting*, we'll give last week's careful engagement another go, this time with four new texts (130 minutes). Then we'll return to games terminology to determine what requires clarification (5 minutes). I'll conclude by introducing you to Taylor's *Watch Me Play* and Gray's *Intersectional Tech* (10 minutes), which we'll discuss next week, and by reviewing Prompt 2, also for next week (5 minutes).

*Prompt 1*: Use 250-300 words (excluding references) to describe a type of play, or a context for play, you might research for this seminar. Please explain why it interests you and how it corresponds with at least one text (required or recommended) we've read thus far. Your audience is other people in this seminar, including me, and you're welcome to write informally. Please include your primary and secondary sources in a references section after your description. I advise spending two hours or less writing your response. No worries. None of this is written in stone, and you might change your mind as the term unfolds. (You'll submit this response on September 29th, but I suggest writing at least a rough draft for today's meeting.)

## Week 4 (September 29th): Broadcasting Play

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Read Kishonna L. Gray's "#Me2, #Me4, Black Women, and Misogynoir: Transmediated Gaming Practices as Intersectional Counterpublics" (28 pages; from *Intersectional Tech: Black Users in Digital Gaming* 2020; coming soon),  
* Read T.L. Taylor's "Twitch and the Work of Play" (21 pages; in *American Journal of Play* 11.1 2018; an excerpt of *Watch Me Play: Twitch and the Rise of Game Live Streaming* 2018),
* Respond to Prompt 2, 
* Submit your early work in progress, and 
* Optional: check out *Assassin's Creed IV: Freedom Cry* and/or *Gears of War* (both mentioned in *Intersectional Tech*).  

How are player stories made and managed in unequal conditions? How do they document and comment on exclusionary politics? How and for whom are they transformative?

*During our fourth meeting*, we'll discuss these two texts (65 minutes) and then outline reasons why people (may want to) produce player stories that document, narrate, broadcast, analyze, contextualize, and/or reflect upon their play experiences (60 minutes). We'll conclude by compiling a list of streams, LPs, video essays, "real-time readings," and the like that may be relevant to your projects this term (20 minutes). I'll also take a second to cover Prompt 3, which is on the horizon (5 minutes). 

*Prompt 2*: Use 250-300 words (excluding references) to describe a type of game or interactive fiction (e.g., a particular genre or style) you might research for this seminar. Please explain why it interests you and how it corresponds with at least one text (required or recommended) we've read thus far. Your audience is other people in this seminar, including me, and you're welcome to write informally. Please include your primary and secondary sources in a references section after the description. I advise spending two hours or less writing your response. Again, no worries. None of this is written in stone, and you might change your mind as the term unfolds.

## Week 5 (October 6th): Performing + Watching Play

*Before seminar*, please:  
* Read Josef Nguyen's ["Performing as Video Game Players in Let's Plays"](https://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/698/615) (22 pages; in *Transformative Works and Cultures* 22 2016),  
* Read Melanie Oberg's "The Video Video Game" (18 pages; in *Popular Culture Studies Journal* 9.2 2021), 
* Draft a response to Prompt 3, and 
* Optional: check out *Amnesia: The Dark Descent*, *Amnesia: Rebirth*, *The Sims*, *Minecraft*, *Kirby's Dream Course*, and/or *Papers, Please* (all mentioned in the assigned reading).

What's the relation between performance, affect, and power in a player story? How are player stories variously interpreted or decoded by audiences? 

*During our fifth meeting*, we'll discuss these two texts (60 minutes) and then start preparing for next week's workshop (30 minutes). A visiting speaker will join us (45 minutes), and you'll also have an opportunity to share some of your thoughts on Prompts 1 and 2 (10 minutes). I'll comment on your early work in progress prior to this meeting, and we'll review Prompt 4 before we go (5 minutes). 

Visiting speaker: TBD

*Prompt 3*: Play one of the [recommended games or fictions](games.html) for at least two hours (including replay if need be), preferably with someone else in the seminar. As you do, try experimenting across different media with three distinct ways to document your performance or experience of play. Then use a total of 300-500 words (excluding references) to describe your three approaches and, in so doing, provide an example or two of each in action. (You can attach, insert, or embed audio, images, video, or text. Any text included in your examples does not count against your allotted 250-300 words.) Since you're collaborating with someone on this one, you are welcome to co-author your response. Please include your primary and secondary sources in a references section after the description and documentation. Aside from time spent playing the game or fiction, I advise spending two hours or less writing your response. Your audience is other people in this seminar, including me, and you are welcome to write informally. (You'll submit this response on November 3rd, but I suggest writing at least a draft for today's meeting.)

## Week 6 (October 13th): First Player Stories Workshop  

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Play Nina Freeman's *Mangia* (Twine version, 2014), 
* Read "*Mangia* by Nina Freeman, Played by Lana Polansky" (44 pages; from *Videogames for Humans* 2015, edited by merritt k),
* Read Austin Walker's "Me, on the Screen: Race in *Animal Crossing: New Leaf*" (12 pages; self-published in 2013 and republished in *The New Statesman* 2013), 
* Start responding to Prompt 4, and 
* Optional: check out *Animal Crossing*, *Street Fighter*, *Final Fantasy*, *Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic*, and/or *Mass Effect* (all mentioned in "Me, on the Screen").  

What's a player story? How might you compose one? Why? And for whom? 

*During our sixth meeting*, we'll hold a workshop on composing player stories. We'll look at examples (including Polansky's engagement with *Mangia*; 20 minutes) and then dedicate about two hours to: 
* Discussing your responses to Prompts 1, 2, and 3, 
* Describing the games and interactive fictions you're playing (e.g., their verbs, avatars, characters, dialogue, cameras, controls, gameplay loops, items, inventories, DKART [Terrell], ECOTAG [Hamilton], pacing, story beats, scenes, leveling, randomization, (extra)diegetic interfaces, art, audio, engines, minigames, and metagames), 
* Describing how your games and fictions tell stories and involve players in that process, 
* Getting permissions and attributing other people's work as part of your research, 
* Making player stories with care for your audience's accessibility needs,
* Navigating attention economics, including "like and subscribe" platforms, 
* Strategic uses of media, software, and narrative in player stories, including the personal, educational, and critical elements of play, and 
* Axiology, reflexivity, affect, and accountability in player stories. 

We'll revisit the [related resources](#related-resources) in this outline (10 minutes), and I'll also circulate the prompt for your player story that's due by December 15th.  

*Prompt 4*: It's time to pick a game or fiction for your player story! Use 300-500 words (excluding references) to identify and describe that game or fiction and then briefly explain why you selected it. Why is the game interesting or relevant today, and why might it warrant a player story? You are welcome to co-author your response, especially if you decide to produce a player story with someone else in the seminar (no more than two people per story, please). Bring the name of the game (or even the game itself) to today's meeting, where you'll have an opportunity to produce draft material for this prompt. Please include your primary and secondary sources in a references section. I advise spending three hours or less writing your response, which you might want to polish *after* today's workshop. Your audience is other people in this seminar, including me, but you may want to write a bit more academically for this one, as you may want to use some of the material for your player story. (You'll submit the response on November 3rd.)

## Week 7 (October 20th): The Gamic Gaze and Player Two 

*Before seminar*, please: 
* Read Shira Chess's "Playing with Identity" (20 pages; from *Reader Player Two: Women Gamers and Designed Identity* 2017),  
* Read Amanda Phillips's "Gender, Power, and the Gamic Gaze" (27 pages; from *Gamer Trouble: Feminist Confrontations in Digital Culture* 2020),

* Optional: Check out *Portal*, *Tomb Raider*, *Bayonetta*, *Kim Kardashian: Hollywood*, *Diner Dash*, *Candy Crush Saga*, and/or *Angry Birds* (all mentioned in the assigned reading). 

How are player stories entwined with voyeurism, co-presence, and commiseration? How do they engage and experiment with designed identities? With the values at play in a game's default settings and their assumptions about gender? 

*During our seventh meeting*, we'll discuss these two texts (75 minutes) and start chatting about your player story methodologies (15 minutes). A visiting speaker will join us (45 minutes), and you'll also have an opportunity to share some of your responses to Prompt 4 (10 minutes), if you wish. We'll conclude by reviewing Prompt 5 (5 minutes). 

Visiting speaker: TBD

* Read Lisa Nakamura's "Don't Hate the Player, Hate the Game: The Racialization of Labor in *World of Warcraft*" (17 pages; in *Critical Studies in Media Communication* 26.2 2009),

When do players "own" their avatars? Under what conditions do they become "workers without bodies"? Or entrepreneurs of themselves? To what effects on how stories are told? 

*During our eighth meeting*, we'll discuss these two texts (60 minutes) and continue chatting about your player story methodologies (15 minutes). A visiting speaker will join us (45 minutes), and you'll also have an opportunity to share some of your experiences playing games and fiction thus far this term (25 minutes). We'll wrap up by attending to what's due next week (your mid-term work in progress) (5 minutes).

Visiting speaker: TBD

*Prompt 5*: Use 500-750 words or 7-10 minutes of audio / video (excluding references) to critically engage any secondary source (assigned or further reading) you've read during Weeks 1-9 of this seminar. (I know it's only Week 8 right now, but you can write about next week's material if you'd like.) Your engagement should be mostly descriptive: describe the text's approach to games and/or interactive fiction, the argument it is making, under what assumptions it is making that argument, and to what effects on your understanding of play, games, and/or player stories. Please include your primary and secondary sources in a references section either in or attached to your work. I advise selecting a text that will inform your player story methodology (see Week 11) and spending three hours or less composing your response. Your audience consists of other students who are also taking a university game studies course, and you should write academically for them. (You'll submit this response on November 3rd, but I suggest getting started this week.)
