# About

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, narrative, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a critical story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How and to what effects might telling critical stories about play feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might critical stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# On "Player Stories"

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. The term appears pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as response to "user story" and salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) as a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in a different direction, toward the horizon of media and cultural studies. Here, a Let's Play or live stream might be serve as an example player story. Yet merritt k's text, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates that neither audio nor video is required. What, then, of content and composition? Must a player story unfold in real time? Or might it be more of reflection? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the historical, personal, cultural, and economic dimensions of play? What, if anything, does fiction have to do with all this? Such questions scratch the surface of the player stories landscape, and experimenting with what player stories are, and what they can do with respect to toxicity, will be our shared line of inquiry this term. If I were to articulate that inquiry as a question, then it would be, "How, for whom, under what assumptions, and to what effects do players document and narrate their experiences of games and interactive fiction?" And by the end of it, you'll make your own. 

# Materials 

No experience with games, media production, or media theory is expected for this seminar, and you won't need access to a gaming computer or console. I am not asking you to purchase any books, either; however, we will be reading chapters from numerous monographs, such as Mary Flanagan's [*Critical Play*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-play), Tara Fickle's [*The Race Card*](https://nyupress.org/9781479805952/the-race-card/), Patrick Jagoda's [*Experimental Games*](*https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo38460558.html), Kishonna L. Gray's [*Intersectional Tech*](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/intersectional-tech/), Amanda Phillips's [*Gamer Trouble*](https://nyupress.org/9781479834921/gamer-trouble/), Bo Ruberg's [*Video Games Have Always Been Queer*](https://nyupress.org/9781479831036/video-games-have-always-been-queer/), and T.L. Taylor's [*Watch Me Play*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183558/watch-me-play). If you find a chapter to be especially compelling and would like to address it in your research for this seminar, then I recommend acquiring the book. 

I like podcasts. How about you? Here are some gaming podcasts that come to mind for this seminar: [*The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook*](https://www.interactive.org/Interviews/the_game_makers_notebook.asp), [*Channel F*](https://www.fanbyte.com/channel-f-fanbyte-podcast/), [*Critical Distance*](https://critical-distance.com/category/podcast/), [*Game Studies Study Buddies*](https://rangedtouch.com/game-studies-study-buddies/), [*Gameplay*](https://gameplay.co/), [*Spawn on Me*](https://www.fanbyte.com/spawn-on-me-podcast/), [*Triple Click*](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/), [*Video Game History Hour*](https://gamehistory.org/the-video-game-history-hour/), [*Waypoint Radio*](https://play.acast.com/s/vicegamingsnewpodcast), and [*Woodland Secrets*](http://woodlandsecrets.co/) all come to mind. You can donate via Patreon where applicable, and let me know if you're looking for a specific angle or format (e.g., interviews with designers or academic commentary). I'll point you to some options.

# Schedule

My primary goal for this seminar is to create a space where you've ample time to develop, refine, and share your own project (i.e., a player story). I've thus kept the reading load to 70 pages or less per week (and frequently much less than that). The seminar includes three workshops on the notion and practice of player stories, and I composed eight prompts to scaffold or direct your inquiry along the way.    

Most of the readings below are available online in PDF and/or HTML care of your UVic Libraries account. You'll notice that I like to recommend related materials, but I in no way expect you to read or study them. We can't read all the things, and I know you've a lot to juggle in a single term. I point to related materials for the sake of scholarly integrity and in case you're interested in following a specific trajectory across game studies toward your own player story. I may also mention these related materials during seminar discussions. If I fail to define a term they use or an argument they make, then please don't hesitate to tell me. I'll clarify.
