# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of media and cultural studies. A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story according to that media and culture paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? Must they unfold in real time, or might they be more reflective? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the historical, cultural, political, economic, aesthetic, technical, and/or personal dimensions of play? What, if anything, does fiction have to do with all this? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to toxicity---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own by the end of it.

Since your player story will be the final project, I will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways (e.g., through seminar discussion, in writing, and via your own player stories methodology). I will also ask you to address the roles of documentation, attribution, accountability, accessibility, narrative, and embodied experience in research, all of which remain deeply relevant to scholarship in the humanities.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media studies, cultural studies, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, but it's my first on player stories. 

# Materials 

No experience with games or media is expected for this seminar, and you won't need access to a gaming computer or console. You will need access to the internet and a computer, though. For your player story, you will also need to play at least one game or interactive fiction, and to document that process in some way. More on that in a second.  

I am not asking you to acquire any books for this seminar, either. I will instead distribute a course reader of screen-readable PDFs, which you may choose to print. If a PDF in that course reader is not accessible or searchable, then please let me know. I'll fix and redistribute it.

To recap, then, you don't need to buy any books or games for this seminar, but you will need access to: 
* The internet, 
* A computer, 
* The course reader, which I'll circulate in PDF, 
* A game (see more below), and 
* A way to document your experiences playing that game (also more below). 

## Pick a Game or Interactive Fiction

A player story needs a game or fiction, so I created a [list](games.html) to help you pick one. I'm open to suggestions, too. They just need to be games I've played and studied a bit. Thanks for meeting me halfway. 

I'll encourage to you start playing early in the term. This way you can gradually refine your research, gather plenty of documentation, and share your work in progress with us. How you document your play, and how you compose a player story, will be up to you; however, I'll nudge you to try a few techniques before you select one. Importantly, your player story techniques won't need to be high-tech. You can use audio or video, if you wish, or just text and images. I'll cover more of the particulars during the three player story workshops I've planned for the term. 

The balance of this "Materials" section contains recommendations related to game studies. If you don't have the time for that, or you're simply not interested, then no worries. You can skip to ["Aims and Workload."](#aims-and-workload) Choose your own adventure?!?!

## Recommended Reading 

I recommend purchasing merrit k's [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), if you can. It's available as a paperback and ebook (PDF, EPUB, and MOBI), and with it you get playable versions of every game featured in the book. Neat! 

Elsewhere, the course reader is mostly chapters from academic monographs, such as Mary Flanagan's *Critical Play*, Tara Fickle's *The Race Card*, Kishonna L. Gray's *Intersectional Tech*, Patrick Jagoda's *Experimental Games*, Christopher B. Patterson's *Open World Empire*, Amanda Phillips's *Gamer Trouble*, Bo Ruberg's *Video Games Have Always Been Queer*, and T.L. Taylor's *Watch Me Play*. If you find a chapter to be especially compelling, then I recommend acquiring the entire monograph to further your research. 

If you are looking for a primer on writing games criticism, then try Ian Bogost's *How to Talk about Videogames*. There are also popular and academic publications like: 
* [*Uppercut*](https://uppercutcrit.com/), "a games and media site devoted to punching up through high quality content that focuses on highlighting marginalized voices and great criticism."
* [*Funland*](https://funland.itch.io/funland-issue-1), "an all-new digital games publication. Instead of merely being an exercise in nostalgia or aesthetics, it will blend elements of olde with coverage that better reflects our modern tone, scope and politics. In short: A queer GamePro."
* [*First Person Scholar*](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/) (also a podcast), featuring "timely, rigorous, and accessible criticism that challenges all players to engage in what Mary Flanagan calls *critical play*."
* [*Patch*](https://patchmagazine.co.uk/), "an independent news source which
primarily covers video games that are created by independent developers or studios."
* [*Unwinnable*](https://unwinnable.com/), "a website and digital magazine, founded in 2010 to provide a different kind of cultural criticism. We love to read about different perspectives, so we set out to collect a diverse group of contributors, amateur and veteran alike, to tell their stories."
* [*Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology*](https://adanewmedia.org/), "an open-access peer reviewed journal featuring scholarship on gender, new media and technology."
* [*Loading...: The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association*](https://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading), "a forum for publishing original and interdisciplinary academic research on video games."
* [*Well Played*](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/index.php/publication-tag/well-played/), "a forum for in-depth close readings of video games that parse out the various meanings to be found in the experience of playing a game."
* [*Analog Game Studies*](https://analoggamestudies.org/), "a journal dedicated to the academic and popular study of games containing a substantial analog component."
* [*Game Studies*](http://gamestudies.org/2202), "a non-profit, open-access, crossdisciplinary journal dedicated to games research, web-published several times a year; our primary focus is aesthetic, cultural and communicative aspects of computer games, but any previously unpublished article focused on games and gaming is welcome." 
* *Games and Culture*, "an international journal that promotes innovative theoretical and empirical research about games and culture within interactive media."
* *Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds*, which "explores the cultural effects of gaming and virtual worlds across platforms and genres, as their increasing popularity begins to affect culture as a whole."
* *Critical Studies in Media Communication*, "a peer-reviewed publication of the National Communication Association. CSMC publishes original scholarship in mediated and mass communication from a cultural studies and/or critical perspective."

If you're curious about the design side of games, then Anna Anthropy's *Rise of the Videogame Zinesters* is an excellent intro to not only experimental games but also many issues we'll engage this term. Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric Zimmerman's *Rules of Play* is a canonical game design book that you'll find, for example, on UVic English's "Book and Media Studies" PhD exam list. Anthropy also wrote *A Game Design Vocabulary* with Naomi Clark; it grounds game design in "verbs" and storytelling. Brenda Romero and Ian Schreiber's *Challenges for Game Designers* is excellent, too. It's filled with clever exercises, and I've used it in several of my prototyping classes. 

## Recommended Listening 

I like podcasts. You? Here are some podcasts that land somewhere in the zone of game studies:
* [*The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook*](https://www.interactive.org/Interviews/the_game_makers_notebook.asp), which features "in-depth, one-on-one conversations between game makers." 
* [*Channel F*](https://www.fanbyte.com/channel-f-fanbyte-podcast/), where "host merritt k now subjects her coworkers to twisted challenges in order to determine who lives and who dies. Also, video games!"
* [*Critical Distance*](https://critical-distance.com/category/podcast/), "an interview series about game research supported by Critical Distance and the Digital Games Research Association."
* [*Game Studies Study Buddies*](https://rangedtouch.com/game-studies-study-buddies/), "a podcast that makes academic games studies accessible, text by text. Rather than focusing on following or forging a 'canon' of the discipline, media scholar Cameron and literature scholar Michael instead aim to cover an eclectic body of material."

## Recommended Literary Studies

This seminar, like all seminars, is biased. It privileges media and cultural studies of games. This approach is distinct from a literary study of the same material. Since many, if not most, of you have backgrounds in English, below is a list of pertinent literary topics accompanied by some experts on them, with links to key publications. We might touch on these literary topics during seminar discussions, and you're more than welcome to pursue them as part of your player story.  
* Digital fiction and software ([Noah Wardrip-Fruin](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/expressive-processing)),
* Electronic literature ([N. Katherine Hayles](https://undpress.nd.edu/9780268030858/electronic-literature/) and [Scott Rettberg](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Electronic+Literature-p-9781509516773)),
* "Ergodic" literature ([Espen J. Aarseth](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/1398/cybertext)),
* Literary games ([Elizabeth W. Bruss](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/stable/468444?seq=1) and [Astrid Ensslin](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/literary-gaming)),
* Narrative and narratology ([Janet Murray](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck) and [Marie-Laure Ryan](https://ohiostatepress.org/books/titles/9780814215081.html)),
* Theatre ([Brenda Laurel](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/computers-as-theatre/9780133390889/) and [Gina Bloom](https://www.press.umich.edu/9831118/gaming_the_stage)), and
* Video games and storytelling ([Souvik Mukherjee](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137525055)).

There are also curatorial projects such as: 
* Hayles et al.'s [*Electronic Literature Collection*](https://collection.eliterature.org/), 
* Aaron A. Reed's [*50 Years of Text Games*](https://if50.substack.com/archive?sort=new), 
* Dene Grigar et al.'s [*The NEXT*](https://the-next.eliterature.org/), and
* Many many collections on [itch.io](https://itch.io/featured-games-feed?filter=collections).

# Aims and Workload

My primary goal for this seminar is to create a space where you've ample time and resources to develop, refine, and share your own project (i.e., a player story). I've thus kept the reading load to 70 pages or less per week (and often only an article or chapter). 

I've also designed three workshops on the praxis of making your own player story, and I cooked up eight prompts to scaffold or direct your inquiry from early September to early December. Here are those prompts, in brief:  
* Prompt 1 (draft by Sept. 22; due Sept. 29): Use 250-300 words to describe a type of play, or a context for play, that most interests you.
* Prompt 2 (due Sept. 29): Use 250-300 words to describe a type of game or fiction that most interests you. 
* Prompt 3 (draft by Oct. 6; due Nov. 3): Play a game or fiction, preferably with someone else in the seminar. Experiment with three ways to document your performance or experience of play. Then use 250-300 words to describe your three approaches and provide examples along the way. 
* Prompt 4 (draft by Oct. 13; due Nov. 3): It's time to pick a game for your player story! Use 250-400 words to describe your game, explain why you selected it, and complete a worksheet about it. 
* Prompt 5 (due Nov. 3): Use 500-750 words to outline your player stories methodology, supported by a primary source (a game or fiction), another player story (a model or inspiration), and 3-5 secondary sources.
* Prompt 6 (draft by Nov. 17; due Dec. 1): Use 500-750 words (plus images) or 7-10 minutes of audio / video to engage any text we've read through play. 
* Prompt 7 (draft by Nov. 24; due Dec. 1): Use 250 words to write an abstract for your player story. Identify the intended audience.  
* Prompt 8 (due Dec. 1): Submit a draft of your player story in the form of a seminar demo or presentation. 

I'll invite you to compose your player story across media: image and text, audio and text, or video, for instance. The final draft is due by December 15th, and I will circulate a detailed prompt for it on October 20th. By that December 15th due date, you'll also have a chance to outline any significant revisions (a "revisions statement") you'd make to Prompts 1-7, without having to actually revise them.

Your player story, revisions statement, and responses to Prompts 1-8 comprise your seminar portfolio, which I will assess like so: 
* Early work in progress (due Sept. 29; 10% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 1 and 2 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* Mid-term work in progress (due Nov. 3; 20% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 3, 4, and 5 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* Late-term work in progress (due Dec. 1; 25% of your final mark): Your responses to Prompts 6, 7, and 8 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include. 
* Final project (due Dec. 15; 35% of your final mark): The final draft of your player story. 
* Revisions statement (due Dec. 15; 10% of your final mark): 300-400 words outlining significant revisions you would make to your responses to Prompts 1-7. 

I suggest dedicating 6 to 9 hours of study each week to this seminar, plus 3 hours for the weekly seminar meetings. Of course, 6 to 9 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved.
