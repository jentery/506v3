# tl;dr Version of this Outline

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a succinct guide to steward your trek through this seminar? 

I made a [one-page, tl;dr version of this outline](guide.html) for your reference. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's accessible in a pinch. 

# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of media and cultural studies. A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story in that media and culture paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? What do they tell us? Must they unfold in real time, and how are they reflexive? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the historical, cultural, political, economic, aesthetic, technical, and/or personal dimensions of play? What, if anything, does fiction have to do with all this? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to games and toxicity---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own by the end of it.

Since your player story will be your final project, this seminar will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways: during seminar discussions, in writing, through play, and via your player stories methodology, for example. I will also ask you to address the roles of documentation, attribution, accountability, accessibility, affect, and narrative in research, all of which remain deeply relevant to scholarship across the humanities, not just in game studies.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media, games, cultural criticism, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, but it's my first on player stories. 

# Materials 

No experience with games or media is expected for this seminar, and you won't need access to a gaming computer or console. You will need access to the internet and a computer, though. For your final project, I will prompt you to play at least one game or interactive fiction, and to document and narrate that process in some way. More on that in a second.  

I am not asking you to purchase any books for this seminar. I will instead direct you to materials in UVic Libraries and distribute a course reader of screen-readable PDFs that you may choose to print. If a PDF in the course reader is not accessible or searchable, then please let me know. I'll fix and redistribute it.

To recap, then, you're not required to purchase anything for this seminar, but you will need access to: 
* The internet, 
* A computer, 
* UVic Libraries, 
* The course reader, which I'll circulate in PDF, 
* A game or interactive fiction (see list of options below), and 
* A way to document your experiences playing that game or fiction (also more below). 

## Pick a Game or Interactive Fiction

A player story is nothing without its primary source, so I created a [list of games and interactive fictions](games.html) to help you pick one. I'm open to suggestions, too. They just need to be works I've played and studied a bit. Thanks for meeting me halfway. 

I'll encourage to you start playing early in the term. This way you can gradually refine your research, gather plenty of documentation, and share your work in progress. How you document your play, how you define and compose a player story, and what you ultimately say or argue will be up to you; however, I'll nudge you to try a few techniques before you select one. Importantly, your player stories don't need to be high-tech. You can use audio or video, if you wish, or just text and images. I'll cover more of the particulars during the three player story workshops I've planned for the term (see Weeks 6, 12, and 13). 

The balance of this "Materials" section contains recommendations related to game studies. If you don't have the time for that, or you're simply not interested, then no worries. You can skip to ["Aims and Workload."](#aims-and-workload) Choose your own adventure?!?!

## Recommended Reading 

I recommend purchasing merritt k's [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html). It's available as a paperback and ebook (PDF, EPUB, and MOBI), and with it you get playable versions of every featured game. *Videogames for Humans* will offer us a sharp sense of what player stories are and what they can do.  

Elsewhere, we'll be reading chapters from several academic monographs, such as Shira Chess's *Reader Player Two*, Tara Fickle's *The Race Card*, Kishonna L. Gray's *Intersectional Tech*, Patrick Jagoda's *Experimental Games*, Christopher B. Patterson's *Open World Empire*, Amanda Phillips's *Gamer Trouble*, Bo Ruberg's *Video Games Have Always Been Queer*, and T.L. Taylor's *Watch Me Play*. If you find a chapter to be especially compelling and relevant to your interests, then I recommend acquiring the entire monograph to further your research. 

If you are looking for a primer on writing games criticism, then try Ian Bogost's *How to Talk about Videogames* (available online via UVic Libraries). There are also many popular and academic publications that engage games in some way. Among them are: 
* [*Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media, and Technology*](https://adanewmedia.org/), "an open-access peer reviewed journal featuring scholarship on gender, new media and technology."
* [*American Journal of Play*](https://www.museumofplay.org/journalofplay/), which "features interviews, book reviews, and original peer-reviewed research for a wide readership of scholars, educators, policymakers, museum and industry professionals, healthcare workers, and those who seek to understand the importance and impact of play in our world."
* [*Analog Game Studies*](https://analoggamestudies.org/), "a journal dedicated to the academic and popular study of games containing a substantial analog component."
* *Critical Studies in Media Communication* (available online via UVic Libraries), "a peer-reviewed publication of the National Communication Association. CSMC publishes original scholarship in mediated and mass communication from a cultural studies and/or critical perspective."
* [*First Person Scholar*](http://www.firstpersonscholar.com/) (also a podcast), featuring "timely, rigorous, and accessible criticism that challenges all players to engage in what Mary Flanagan calls *critical play*."
* [*Funland*](https://funland.itch.io/funland-issue-1), "an all-new digital games publication. Instead of merely being an exercise in nostalgia or aesthetics, it will blend elements of olde with coverage that better reflects our modern tone, scope and politics. In short: A queer GamePro."
* *Games and Culture* (available online via UVic Libraries), "an international journal that promotes innovative theoretical and empirical research about games and culture within interactive media."
* [*Game Studies*](http://gamestudies.org/2202), "a non-profit, open-access, crossdisciplinary journal dedicated to games research, web-published several times a year; our primary focus is aesthetic, cultural and communicative aspects of computer games, but any previously unpublished article focused on games and gaming is welcome." 
* *Journal of Cinema and Media Studies* (available online via UVic Libraries), the mission of which "is to foster engaged debate and rigorous thinking among humanities scholars of film, television, digital media, and other audiovisual technologies."
* *Journal of Gaming and Virtual Worlds*, which "explores the cultural effects of gaming and virtual worlds across platforms and genres, as their increasing popularity begins to affect culture as a whole."
* [*Loading...: The Journal of the Canadian Game Studies Association*](https://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading), "a forum for publishing original and interdisciplinary academic research on video games."
* [*Patch*](https://patchmagazine.co.uk/), "an independent news source which primarily covers video games that are created by independent developers or studios."
* [*Unwinnable*](https://unwinnable.com/), "a website and digital magazine, founded in 2010 to provide a different kind of cultural criticism. We love to read about different perspectives, so we set out to collect a diverse group of contributors, amateur and veteran alike, to tell their stories."
* [*Uppercut*](https://uppercutcrit.com/), "a games and media site devoted to punching up through high quality content that focuses on highlighting marginalized voices and great criticism."
* [*Well Played*](https://press.etc.cmu.edu/index.php/publication-tag/well-played/), "a forum for in-depth close readings of video games that parse out the various meanings to be found in the experience of playing a game."

If you're curious about the design side of games, then Anna Anthropy's *Rise of the Videogame Zinesters* is an excellent intro to not only experimental games but also many issues we'll engage this term. Katie Salen Tekinbaş and Eric Zimmerman's *Rules of Play* is a canonical game design book that you'll find, for example, on UVic English's "Book and Media Studies" PhD exam list. Anthropy also wrote *A Game Design Vocabulary* with Naomi Clark; it grounds game design in "verbs" and storytelling. Brenda Romero and Ian Schreiber's *Challenges for Game Designers* is excellent, too. It's full of clever exercises, and I've used it in several of my prototyping classes.
