# About

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, narrative, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a critical story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How and to what effects might telling critical stories about play feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might critical stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. The term appears pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as response to "user story" and salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) as a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of media and cultural studies. A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story according to that media and culture paradigm. Yet merritt k's text, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates that neither audio nor video is required for such a story. What, then, of content and composition? Must a player story unfold in real time? Or might it be more reflective? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the historical, cultural, economic, aesthetic, technical, and personal dimensions of play? What, if anything, does fiction have to do with all this? Such questions scratch the surface of the player stories landscape, and experimenting with what player stories are, and what they can do with respect to toxicity, will be our shared line of inquiry this term. Our primary question will be something like, "How, for whom, under what assumptions, and to what effects do players document and narrate their experiences of games and interactive fiction?" By the end of it, you'll make your own. 

Many thanks to [Melanie Oberg](https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/team/melanie-oberg/), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her research. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# Materials 

No experience with games, media production, or media theory is expected for this seminar, and you won't need access to a gaming computer or console. I am not asking you to purchase any books, either; however, I recommend [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html). We will also read chapters from numerous monographs, such as Mary Flanagan's [*Critical Play*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-play), Tara Fickle's [*The Race Card*](https://nyupress.org/9781479805952/the-race-card/), Kishonna L. Gray's [*Intersectional Tech*](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/intersectional-tech/), Patrick Jagoda's [*Experimental Games*](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/E/bo38460558.html), Amanda Phillips's [*Gamer Trouble*](https://nyupress.org/9781479834921/gamer-trouble/), Bo Ruberg's [*Video Games Have Always Been Queer*](https://nyupress.org/9781479831036/video-games-have-always-been-queer/), and T.L. Taylor's [*Watch Me Play*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183558/watch-me-play). If you find a chapter to be especially compelling and would like to address or apply it in this seminar, then I recommend acquiring the entire monograph. If you are looking for a primer on games criticism, then I suggest Ian Bogost's [*How to Talk about Videogames*](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/how-to-talk-about-videogames). Anna Anthropy's [*Rise of the Videogame Zinesters*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/215174/rise-of-the-videogame-zinesters-by-anna-anthropy/) is also an excellent intro to many of the issues we'll engage this term. 

I like podcasts. You? Here are some podcasts that land somewhere near or inside the zone of game studies: [*The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook*](https://www.interactive.org/Interviews/the_game_makers_notebook.asp), [*Channel F*](https://www.fanbyte.com/channel-f-fanbyte-podcast/), [*Critical Distance*](https://critical-distance.com/category/podcast/), [*Game Studies Study Buddies*](https://rangedtouch.com/game-studies-study-buddies/), [*Gameplay*](https://gameplay.co/), [*Spawn on Me*](https://www.fanbyte.com/spawn-on-me-podcast/), [*Triple Click*](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/triple-click/), [*Video Game History Hour*](https://gamehistory.org/the-video-game-history-hour/), [*Waypoint Radio*](https://play.acast.com/s/vicegamingsnewpodcast), and [*Woodland Secrets*](http://woodlandsecrets.co/). None of this is required listening. But if you do, then you can donate via Patreon where applicable. Since this list is pretty long, and many of these podcasts pass the 100 episode mark, feel free to let me know if you're looking for a specific angle or format (e.g., academic commentary, certain topics, or interviews with designers). I'll point you to some options.

Finally, I should mention that we'll focus primarily on media and cultural studies of games and interactive fiction. This approach is distinct from a literary study of the same material. Since many, if not most, of you have backgrounds in English, here's a list of relevant literary topics and some experts on them: digital fiction and software ([Noah Wardrip-Fruin](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/expressive-processing)), electronic literature ([N. Katherine Hayles](https://undpress.nd.edu/9780268030858/electronic-literature/) and [Scott Rettberg](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Electronic+Literature-p-9781509516773)), "ergodic" literature ([Espen J. Aarseth](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/1398/cybertext)), literary games ([Elizabeth W. Bruss](https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.library.uvic.ca/stable/468444?seq=1) and [Astrid Ensslin](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/literary-gaming)), narrative and narratology ([Janet Murray](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck) and [Marie-Laure Ryan](https://ohiostatepress.org/books/titles/9780814215081.html)), theatre ([Brenda Laurel](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/computers-as-theatre/9780133390889/) and [Gina Bloom](https://www.press.umich.edu/9831118/gaming_the_stage)), and video games and storytelling ([Souvik Mukherjee](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137525055)). There are also curatorial projects such as Hayles et al.'s [*Electronic Literature Collection*](https://collection.eliterature.org/), Aaron A. Reed's [*50 Years of Text Games*](https://if50.substack.com/archive?sort=new), Dene Grigar et al.'s [*The NEXT*](https://the-next.eliterature.org/), and many many collections on [itch.io](https://itch.io/featured-games-feed?filter=collections).

# Schedule

My primary goal for this seminar is to create a space where you've ample time to develop, refine, and share your own project (i.e., a player story). I've thus kept the reading load to 70 pages or less per week (and frequently much less than that). The seminar includes three workshops on the notion, practice, and composition of player stories, and I cooked up eight prompts to scaffold or direct your inquiry along the way.    

Most of the readings below are available online in PDF and/or HTML care of your UVic Libraries account. You'll notice that *I like to recommend related materials, but I in no way expect you to read or study what I recommend.* We can't read all the things, and I know you've a lot to juggle in a single term. I refer to related materials for the sake of scholarly integrity and in case you're interested in following a specific trajectory across game studies. I may also mention these related materials during seminar discussions. If I fail to define a term they use or an argument they make, then please don't hesitate to tell me. I'll clarify. 

One other thing to know about me before we proceed: I always overplan. If what's below becomes too much for us, then I'll cut material, including readings and prompts where need be. 

## September 8th: Introductions 

*Before seminar*, please read Eric Hayot's "Video Games and the Novel" (10 pages; *Daedalus* 150.1). 

I selected this essay because it reflects how some literary critics might approach games and interactive fiction, and thus as a familiar (???) starting point for those of us with backgrounds in English. As you read, you might note where you agree, disagree, and need more elaboration or context from Hayot. What does the argument assume, ignore, and privilege? Note that Hayot's essay was published in an invitation-only [special issue](https://direct.mit.edu/daed/issue/150/1) of *Daedalus* on the novel as a literary form. Its conversational style and conventions thus differ from what you'll usually encounter in most peer-reviewed academic journals in the arts and humanities. 

*During our first meeting*, we'll introduce ourselves, review the plan for this term, and share our questions and concerns. We'll then discuss Hayot's essay, which I'll use to stage some ongoing conversations in media and cultural studies of games (and how they might unfold alongside and against literary studies). We'll conclude by surveying some key terms in game studies: terms like diegetic and nondiegetic action (Alexander Galloway), environmental storytelling (Henry Jenkins), expressive processing (Noah Wardrip-Fruin), the faculty of mimesis (Walter Benjamin), ludonarrative dissonance (Clint Hocking), mediated collaboration (Brenda Laurel), multiform story (Janet Murray), procedural rhetoric (Ian Bogost), and others appearing in [this Wikipedia glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms), [this dictionary](https://www.half-real.net/dictionary/) by Jesper Juul, and/or this [critical glossary](http://critical-gaming.squarespace.com/storage/Critical-Gaming_glossary_Richard_Terrell.pdf) by Richard Terrell (KirbyKid). I hope this introduction to common terms is especially useful for those of you who've never taken a course on games and/or media. We'll return to it later in the term to ensure the words we're bandying are clear to everyone.

## September 15th: Play and Games, Part 1 

*Before seminar*, please read Brian Sutton-Smith's "Play and Ambiguity" (17 pages; from *The Ambiguity of Play*), Mary Flanagan's "Introduction to Critical Play" (15 pages; from *Critical Play*), Mia Consalvo's "Cheating" (6 pages) and Grant Tavinor's "Fiction" (8 pages; both from *The Routledge Companion to Video Game Studies*), and Alenda Y. Chang's "Digital Games" (16 pages; from *The Cambridge Companion to Literature and the Anthropocene*). 

*During our second meeting*, we'll discuss these five texts during seminar, carefully engaging them page by page to describe their lines of inquiry across play and games. We'll also consider ways to approach play and games in context (as opposed to strict or ahistorical definitions of either). 

I recommend Matthew Thomas Payne and Nina B. Huntemann's "A Game Genie for Game Studies" (13 pages; from *How to Play Video Games*) and Nick Montfort's ["Toward a Theory of Interactive Fiction"](https://nickm.com/if/toward.html) (21 pages; from *IF Theory Reader*).

## September 22nd: Play and Games, Part 2 

*Before seminar*, please read C.L.R. James's "'What Is Art?'" (16 pages; from *Beyond a Boundary*), Bo Ruberg's "No Fun" (18 pages; from *Video Games Have Always Been Queer*), Tara Fickle's "West of the Magic Circle" (20 pages; from *The Race Card*), and Elizabeth A. LaPensée, Outi Laiti, and Maize Longboat's "Towards Sovereign Games" (16 pages; from *Games and Culture*).  

*During our third meeting*, we'll give that page-by-page, careful engagement another go with these four texts. Then we'll return to matters of terminology in and around game studies. I'll conclude by introducing you to Taylor's *Watch Me Play* and Gray's *Intersectional Tech*, which we'll discuss next week. 

*Prompt 1*: Use 250-300 words to describe a type of play, or a context for play, that most interests you for the purposes of research in this seminar. Please explain why it interests you and how it corresponds with at least one text we've read thus far. No worries. None of this is written in stone. You might change your mind as the term unfolds. (You'll submit your response to this prompt on the 29th, but I suggest writing at least a draft for today's meeting.)

I recommend Soraya Murray's "Video Games and Playable Media" (6 pages; from *Feminist Media Histories*), Aaron Trammell's "Decolonizing Play" (9 pages; from *Critical Studies in Media Communication*), Kishonna L. Gray's "The 'Problem' of Intersectionality in Digital Gaming Culture" (15 pages; from *Intersectional Tech*), Edmond Y. Chang's "Queergaming" (9 pages; from *Queer Game Studies*), and Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux's "Breaking the Metagame" (16 pages; from *Metagaming*).

## September 29th: Broadcasting Play

*Before seminar*, please read T.L. Taylor's "Broadcasting Ourselves" (22 pages; from *Watch Me Play*) and Kishonna L. Gray's "Hypervisible Blackness, Invisible Narratives" (31 pages; from *Intersectional Tech*). 

*During our fourth meeting*, we'll discuss these two texts and then outline reasons why people (may want to) produce "player stories" that document, narrate, broadcast, analyze, and/or reflect upon their play experiences. We'll conclude by starting a list of streams, LPs, video essays, "real-time readings," and the like that may be relevant to your projects this term.  

*Prompt 2*: Use 250-300 words to describe a type of game or fiction (e.g., a particular genre or style) that most interests you for the purposes of this seminar. Please also explain why it interests you and how it corresponds with at least one text we've read thus far. (Later in the term, you'll focus on a specific game or fiction. For now, you can attend more generally to a style or genre.) No worries. Again, none of this is written in stone, and you might change your mind and follow a different direction as the term unfolds. 

*Please submit your early work in progress* (10% of your final mark). This submission should include your responses to Prompts 1 and 2 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include.
