# tl;dr Version of this Outline

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward your trek through this graduate seminar? 

I made a one-page, [tl;dr version of this outline](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. This guide is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's convenient in a pinch. 

# About the Seminar

Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, many of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, cultural, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How might player stories feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? The final question regards memory work: How might stories about play be archived with universities and other public institutions to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

# What's a Player Story?

There's no consensus on what "player story" means or implies in the context of games and interactive fiction. It functions pragmatically in [industry](https://blog.agilegamedevelopment.com/2020/04/player-stories.html) as an alternative to "user story," and it's used salaciously on [Wattpad](https://www.wattpad.com/stories/player) to denote a (sub)genre of fan fiction. Although I'm certainly tempted to teach a course about the latter, we'll spin player stories in another direction, toward the horizon of game studies. How, for whom, under what assumptions, and to what effects do people document and narrate their experiences of games and interactive fiction? A Let's Play video or live stream might be a player story in that media and culture paradigm. Yet merritt k's book, [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), demonstrates why neither audio nor video is necessary for such a story. 

What, then, of content and composition? What are player stories *about*? What do they say, and what do they tell us? Must they unfold in real time, and how might they be reflexive? How do players perform or present themselves in their stories? How do they navigate the personal and cultural dimensions of play, not to mention the narratives at work in games and fiction? Such questions reveal the motivations for this seminar, and experimenting with the praxis of player stories---and what they can *do* with respect to games and toxicity---will be our shared line of inquiry this term. You'll make your own by the end of it, about a game or fiction of your choice, using a player stories methodology of your own design. This means you'll have room to experiment, develop a unique line of inquiry through the seminar, and ultimately define "player story" not only on your own terms but also through an example or "prototype." 

Since your player story will be your final project, we will not dwell much on how to write journal articles or monographs in game studies. We will nevertheless read criticism in the field, and I'll ask you to engage it in various ways: during seminar discussions, in writing, through play, and via your player stories methodology, for example. I will also ask you to address the roles of documentation, accountability, accessibility, affect, and narrative in research, each of which remains deeply relevant to scholarship across the humanities, not just in game studies.  

Many thanks to Melanie Oberg (University of Alberta), who introduced me to Let's Plays as part of her research and sparked my interest in player stories back in 2015-16. We'll read some of her work this term. 

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him). I'm a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT). I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies, and I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS at Virginia Commonwealth University. I'm in the middle of writing a book about the sounds of "playable fiction." I teach media, games, cultural criticism, and American literature at UVic. This is my eleventh graduate seminar here, though it's my first on player stories. 

# Required Materials 

No experience with games or media is expected for this seminar. I will assume you are new to game studies. 

You won't need access to a gaming computer or console; however, you will need access to the internet and a computer. For your final project, I will prompt you to play at least one game or interactive fiction, and to document and narrate that process in some way. More on that in a second.  

I am not asking you to purchase any books for this seminar. I will instead direct you to materials in UVic Libraries and also distribute a course reader of screen-readable PDFs that you may choose to print. If a PDF in the course reader is not accessible or searchable, then please let me know. I'll fix and redistribute it.

The following fair dealing statement applies to each PDF appearing in the course reader: "This copy was made pursuant to the Fair Dealing Guidelines of the University, library database licenses, and other university license and policies. The copy may only be used for the purpose of research, private study, criticism, review, news reporting, education, satire or parody. If the copy is used for the purpose of review, criticism or news reporting, the source and the name of the author must be mentioned. The use of this copy for any other purpose may require the permission of the copyright owner."

To recap, then, you're not required to purchase anything for this seminar, yet you will need access to: 
* The internet, 
* A computer, 
* UVic Libraries, 
* The course reader, which I'll circulate in PDF, 
* A game or interactive fiction (see list of options below), and 
* A way to document your experiences playing that game or fiction (also more below). 

Finally, I invite you to visit the [related materials](#related-materials) section of this outline for lists of game studies books, journals, podcasts, and resources I suggest if you find yourself to be keen on the field. 

## Pick a Game or Interactive Fiction

A player story is nothing without its primary source, so I created a [list of games and interactive fictions](games.html) to help you pick one. I'm open to suggestions, too. They just need to be works I've played and studied a bit. Thanks for meeting me halfway. 

I'll encourage to you start playing early in the term. This way you can refine your research, gather plenty of documentation, and share your work in progress. How you document your play, how you define and compose a player story, and what you ultimately say or argue will be up to you; however, I'll nudge you to try a few techniques before you select one for your project. Importantly, your player stories don't need to be high-tech. You can use audio or video, if you wish, or just text and images. I'll cover more of the particulars during the three player story workshops I've planned for the term (see Weeks 6, 12, and 13). For now, let's talk about the aims, workload, and prompts for this seminar.
