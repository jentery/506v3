# tl;dr Version of this Syllabus

In a rush? Overwhelmed by the start of term? Need a guide to steward you through this seminar? 

I made a [one-page, tl;dr version of this syllabus](guide.html) for you. I'll print you a [PDF copy](guide.pdf), too. The tl;dr is not intended to replace the syllabus, but I hope it's a useful reference in a pinch.
