Among the most fascinating aspects of games and interactive fiction are the stories people tell with them, and the entertainment industry is well aware of this phenomenon. Millions of Twitch and YouTube viewers now watch recorded and streaming videos of people playing games and narrating their play experiences. Unfortunately, most of these videos also contribute to a toxic culture where play becomes precarious labour for proprietary platforms as well as an instrument for trolling and harassment. Many players who want to share their stories are thus dissuaded from participating, not only because of the technological barrier to entry but also given concerns for their own health and safety. The result online, particularly in venues such as Twitch and YouTube, is a skewed representation of the political, narrative, and aesthetic potential of games and interactive fiction. 

This seminar responds to such toxic culture with four questions, which we will address through a combination of primary and secondary sources. The first considers the attention economics of recorded and streaming video: How do the stories people tell with games and interactive fiction change when they are not immediately, if ever, intended for circulation on "like and subscribe" platforms? The next question is a matter of education: How do players tell stories critically, and to what degree does writing or witnessing a critical story help them to unlearn toxicity? The third is one of culture: How and to what effects might telling critical stories about play feed back into gaming communities, including those known to be toxic? And the final question regards memory work: How might critical stories about play be archived with universities to document games and interactive fiction, which are notoriously subject to planned obsolescence? Or, from another angle, how might player stories persist when games and interactive fiction do not? 

No experience with games, media production, or media theory is expected for this seminar, and you will not need access to a gaming computer or console. I am not asking you to purchase any books, either, but I recommend Mary Flanagan's [*Critical Play*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/critical-play), Kishonna L. Gray's [*Intersectional Tech*](https://lsupress.org/books/detail/intersectional-tech/), merritt k's [*Videogames for Humans*](https://www.instarbooks.com/books/videogames-for-humans.html), Amanda Phillips's [*Gamer Trouble*](https://nyupress.org/9781479834921/gamer-trouble/), Bo Ruberg's [*Video Games Have Always Been Queer*](https://nyupress.org/9781479831036/video-games-have-always-been-queer/), and/or T.L. Taylor's [*Watch Me Play*](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691183558/watch-me-play). We'll read chapters from each of these books this term, and in particular *Videogames for Humans* provides us with many examples of  "low-tech" player stories (no video or audio). If you're interested in gaming podcasts, then *The AIAS Game Maker's Notebook*, *Channel F*, *Critical Distance*, *Game Studies Study Buddies*, *Gameplay*, *Spawn on Me*, *Triple Click*, *Video Game History Hour*, *Waypoint Radio*, and *Woodland Secrets* all come to mind. You can donate via Patreon, where applicable.  

Unless stated otherwise, all readings below are available online in PDF and/or HTML care of your UVic Libraries account. You'll notice that I often recommend or point to related materials, but I in no way expect you to read or study them. I provide them for the sake of scholarly integrity and in case you're interested in a specific aspect of game studies. My primary goal for this seminar is to create a space where you've ample time to develop, refine, and share your own project. I've thus kept the reading load to less than 70 pages per week (frequently much less than that) and composed eight prompts to scaffold or direct your inquiry along the way. The seminar also includes three workshops on the notion and practice of player stories.   

## September 8th: Introductions 

Prior to seminar, please read this "Player Stories" outline as well as Eric Hayot's "Video Games and the Novel" (10 pages). Thank you! 

If you are curious about the intersections between literary studies and game studies, then Espen Aarseth's [*Cybertext*](https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/1398/cybertext), Elizabeth W. Bruss's ["The Games of Literature and Some Literary Games,"](http://newliteraryhistory.org/) the [Electronic Literature Collection](https://collection.eliterature.org/), Astrid Ensslin's [*Literary Gaming*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/literary-gaming), N. Katherine Hayles's ["Electronic Literature: What Is It?"](https://eliterature.org/pad/elp.html), Souvik Mukherjee's [*Video Games and Storytelling*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9781137525055), Janet Murray's [*Hamlet on the Holodeck*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/hamlet-holodeck), Aaron A. Reed's [*50 Years of Text Games*](https://if50.substack.com/archive?sort=new), Marie-Laure Ryan's ["From Narrative Games to Playable Stories,"](https://nebraskapressjournals.unl.edu/issue/9000017406928/storyworlds-011/) and Noah Wardrip-Fruin's [*Expressive Processing*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/expressive-processing) are excellent places to start. The intersections between literature and games won't be the focus on this seminar; however, you're welcome to pursue them in your research project. 

During our first meeting, we'll introduce ourselves, review the plan for this term, and share our questions and concerns. We'll then discuss Hayot's essay, which I'll use to not only stage some ongoing conversations in game studies (and how they might unfold alongside literary studies) but also define a few key terms in the field: terms like ludology, narratology, procedural rhetoric, diegetic, extradiegetic, mimesis, mechanics, magic circle, ludonarrative dissonance, environmental storytelling, and others appearing in [this Wikipedia glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms), [this dictionary](https://www.half-real.net/dictionary/) by Jesper Juul, and/or this [critical glossary](https://critical-gaming.squarespace.com/critical-glossary/) by Richard Terrell [KirbyKid]). I hope this introduction to terminology is especially useful for those of you who've never taken a media or game studies course. 

## September 15th: Play and Games, Part 1 

Please read Brian Sutton-Smith's "Play and Ambiguity" (17 pages), Mary Flanagan's "Introduction to Critical Play" (15 pages), Mia Consalvo's "Rule Sets, Cheating, and Magic Circles" (6 pages), and Stephanie Boluk and Patrick LeMieux's "Metagaming" (22 pages). Of note, Boluk and LeMieux's *Metagaming* book is open access. You can read all of it online if you wish. 

We'll discuss these four texts during seminar, carefully engaging them page by page to describe their lines of inquiry across play and games.   

## September 22nd: Play and Games, Part 2 

Please read C.L.R. James's "'What Is Art?'" (17 pages), Bo Ruberg's "No Fun" (18 pages), Aaron Trammell's "Decolonizing Play" (9 pages), and Elizabeth A. LaPensée, Outi Laiti, and Maize Longboat's "Towards Sovereign Games" (16 pages). 

I recommend Soraya Murray's "Video Games and Playable Media" (6 pages) for some historical context.

We'll give that page-by-page, careful engagement another go with these four texts. Then we'll return to matters of terminology in and around game studies. I'll conclude by introducing you to some terminology and arguments in Taylor's *Watch Me Play* and Gray's *Intersectional Tech* (see below). 

*Prompt 1*: Use 250-300 words to describe a type of play, or a context for play, that most interests you for the purposes of research in this seminar. Please explain why it interests you and how it corresponds with at least one text we've read thus far. No worries. None of this is written in stone. You might change your mind or trajectory as the term unfolds. (You'll submit your response to this prompt on the 29th, but I recommend writing at least a draft of it for today's meeting.)

## September 29th: Broadcasting Play

Please read T.L. Taylor's "Broadcasting Ourselves" (22 pages) and Kishonna L. Gray's "Hypervisible Blackness, Invisible Narratives" (31 pages). Both of these chapters are from monographs by their authors. On the 22nd, I will define and contextualize any key terms from those monographs that you may need to know prior to reading the chapters. 

["It's about Safety in Gaming with T.L. Taylor"](https://publicinfrastructure.org/podcast/60-tl-taylor/) (44 minutes), ["Dr. Gray Interviewed by Spawn on Me Podcast Host, Kahlief Adams at the Xbox Live Blacks in Gaming Event"](http://www.equityingaming.com/news-and-media.html) (18 minutes), and ["Fireside Chat: Kishonna Gray, Maize Longboat, and Micaela Mantegna"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EeqLtDxnS_c) (64 minutes) may be of interest, too. 

We'll discuss Taylor's and Gray's work during seminar and then outline reasons why people (may want to) produce "player stories" that document, narrate, broadcast, analyze, and reflect upon their play experiences. We'll conclude by starting a list of streams, LPs, video essays, "real-time readings," and the like that may be relevant to your research this term.  

*Prompt 2*: Use 250-300 words to describe a type of game or fiction (e.g., a particular genre or style) that most interests you for the purposes of this seminar. Please also explain why it interests you and how it corresponds with at least one text we've read thus far. (Later in the term, you'll focus on a specific work. For now, you can attend more generally to a style or genre.) No worries. Again, none of this is written in stone, and you might change your mind and follow a different direction as the term unfolds. 

Please submit your early work in progress (10% of your final mark). This submission should include your responses to Prompts 1 and 2 as well as any notes or documentation you wish to include.  

## October 6th: Performing Play

Please read Josef Nguyen's ["Performing as Video Game Players in Let's Plays"](https://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/698/615) (22 pages) and Christopher B. Patterson's "Making Queer Asiatic Worlds" (31 pages). 

I recommend Meg Jayanth's ["*80 Days* & Unexpected Stories"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Apa7Klu8Trg) (32 minutes) for more on worldmaking and integrated storytelling as well as Brenda Laurel's [*Computers as Theatre*](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/computers-as-theatre/9780133390889/) for more on drama and human-computer interaction (HCI). 

We'll discuss Nguyen's and Patterson's work during seminar and then start preparing for our first workshop (on October 20th). You'll also have an opportunity to share some of your responses to Prompts 1 and 2 if you wish. 

*Prompt 3*: Play one of the following games for at least two hours, preferably with someone else in the seminar. As you do, try experimenting across different media (audio, video, images, and text) with three distinct ways to document your performance or experience of play. Then use 250-300 words to describe your three approaches and, in so doing, provide one or two examples of each in action. (You can attach or embed audio, images, and video.) Since you're collaborating with someone else on this one, you are welcome to co-author your response. Here are the games and fictions (again, pick just one): [*Analogue: A Hate Story*](http://ahatestory.com/), [*Birdland*](https://birdland.camp/), [*Butterfly Soup*](https://brianna-lei.itch.io/butterfly-soup), [*Celeste*](http://www.celestegame.com/) (PICO version is fine), [*Chicory*](https://chicorygame.com/), [*Citizen Sleeper*](https://www.fellowtraveller.games/citizen-sleeper), [*Coffee Talk*](https://www.togeproductions.com/project/coffee-talk/), [*Dark Souls*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls/dark-souls), [*Disco Elysium*](https://discoelysium.com/), [*Dys4ia*](https://freegames.org/ca/dys4ia/), [*80 Days*](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days/), [*Elden Ring*](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring), [*Eliza*](https://www.zachtronics.com/eliza/), [*Galatea*](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=urxrv27t7qtu52lb), [*Gone Home*](https://gonehome.com/), [*Hades*](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades/), [*Hair Nah*](https://hairnah.com/), [*The House in Fata Morgana*](https://mangagamer.org/fatamorgana/), [*Inscryption*](https://www.inscryption.com/), [*The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild*](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/), [*Limbo*](https://playdead.com/games/limbo/), [*Minecraft*](https://www.minecraft.net/), [*my body — a Wunderkammer*](https://collection.eliterature.org/1/works/jackson__my_body_a_wunderkammer.html), [*Never Alone*](http://neveralonegame.com/), [*NORC0*](http://norcogame.com/), [*Outer Wilds*](https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html), [*Portal 2*](https://www.thinkwithportals.com/index.php), [*Psychonauts 2*](https://www.doublefine.com/games/psychonauts-2), [*Return of the Obra Dinn*](https://obradinn.com/), [*Scents & Semiosis*](https://tsawac.itch.io/scents), [*The Stanley Parable*](https://www.stanleyparable.com/), [*Stardew Valley*](https://www.stardewvalley.net/), [*Thunderbird Strike*](https://www.thunderbirdstrike.com/), [*Umurangi Generation*](https://www.umurangigeneration.com/), [*Undertale*](https://undertale.com/), [*Unpacking*](https://www.unpackinggame.com/), [*Untitled Goose Game*](https://goose.game/), [*With Those We Love Alive*](https://collection.eliterature.org/3/work.html?work=with-those-we-love-alive), and [*Wildermyth*](https://wildermyth.com/).
