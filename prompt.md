This is the prompt for your final project in this seminar: your player story. 

## Aims of Your Player Story  

Let's say a player story is a format that documents the experience of a game, playing and reacting to it, making meaning of it, being affected by it, and even arguing with it. A player story is, in the words of Kishonna Gray, a "narrative description" that frames a game and contextualizes it. Player stories may be personal, political, creative, critical, social, transformative, educational, entertaining, homemade, and/or professional.

For this seminar, your player story should:  

* Tell a story about at least one game or interactive fiction (your "source material"),
* Document the experience of playing your source material, making meaning of it, being affected by it, and even arguing with it,  
* Have a clear theme or line of inquiry your audience can follow from start to finish, 
* Be intentionally designed and scoped such that it does not try to address every aspect of its source material or all topics related to that material,
* Demonstrate an awareness of your audience and provide them with access to (some of your) source material, and 
* Make a meaningful or compelling use of its media (audio, video, images, and/or words) and format (the player story as defined above). 

## Format for Your Player Story 

Your player story does not have to be high-tech. You are welcome, for instance, to use: 

* 2000-5000 words, plus images and/or embedded media (such as video, GIFs, and audio).

You are also welcome to use: 

* 10-30 minutes of video or audio, which may or may not be scripted.

The style of communication will matter here. Please think carefully and deliberately about when the player story is improvisational and when it's scripted, not to mention how it integrates documentation into its theme or line of inquiry. Please also be mindful of your audience's time. What is essential to your player story, and what may be included as an appendix or "bonus file"?

On that note, I encourage you to understand your player story as a project (presented or published in a single file) available in a repository of files. You might submit your final project as a word processor, HTML, video, or audio file, for example, and along with it include documentation, notes, and material from the cutting room floor. Your final project might even point your audience to other materials, especially documentation, in your repository: "If you want to see how I romanced Steve Cortez, then see minute 7 of dancingAtPurgatory.mp4." 

Your final project should be accompanied by: 

* An abstract (no more than 300 words), which you'll draft for Prompt 7 (see November 24th in the seminar schedule), and 
* Two specific criteria (see more below) you'd like me to consider while assessing your player story. 

## Audience for Your Player Story 

You should identify your intended audience in your abstract, and your player story should demonstrate an awareness of them and how you're addressing them (be it directly or indirectly). Perhaps your player story involves audience engagement, or maybe it doesn't. This choice is yours, as is your choice of audience. That said, I recommend narrowing your audience as much as possible: not, for example, "scholars of media" or "people who play games," but rather "scholars interested in the intersections of race and gender with games and roleplay" or "people who play immersive sims like *Prey*." Again, how you engage this audience is up to you. 

## Assessment of Your Player Story  

I will use the Faculty of Graduate Studies’ [official grading system](https://www.uvic.ca/calendar/future/grad/index.php#/policy/B13jeiMdE?bc=true&bcCurrent=07%20-%20Grading&bcGroup=Faculty%20Academic%20Regulations&bcItemType=policies) to assess your work according to the following criteria: 

* Engagement with the course: how well and to what degree your player story engages a theme in this seminar, a topic of seminar discussion, and/or a research area in game studies we considered this term 
* Selection and creation of content: how persuasively your player story draws from documentation, comments on it (or narrates it), and frames or situates the play experience
* Awareness of audience: how aware you and your story are of your intended audience, who should be identified in your abstract (see above) 
* Quality of the story: how clear, cohesive, refined, and compelling the story is, especially with respect to engaging a theme or line of inquiry  
* Potential of the project: the degree to which your player story could be expanded into a larger project (perhaps about another game) to further develop its themes and techniques
* Two other criteria you will draft during our final workshop (see December 1st in the seminar schedule) and should include alongside your abstract. 

## What to Submit for Your Player Story

You should submit:

1. One file containing your final project (e.g., an MP4 that is 10-30 minutes long or a PDF file containing 2000-5000 words plus images),
2. One file containing both your abstract (no more than 300 words) and your two assessment criteria, and 
3. Optional: a repository of files containing additional documentation, notes, drafts, and other "bonus" files you'd like to include to provide me with context for your player story's production.

You may upload all these to Brightspace. If you need or prefer another mode of delivery for your repository (see 3 above), then let me know. We'll make it work. 

## When to Submit It 

Please submit all of the above by Thursday, December 15th at 9:30am. Thank you!
